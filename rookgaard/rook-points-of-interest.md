# Rook Points of Interest

Rookgaard is a place full of mysteries and challenges for adventures that decided to stay on the island. One of this challenge is to collect all the Point of Interest across the island.

There are 23 Point of Interest in total, some of them in the most iconic and famous places of the isle, others can be found in dangerous and challenging places like quest or Bosses. You can check how many you have by clicking on the statue in the middle of the city:
