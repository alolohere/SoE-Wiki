#### Strategies <a href="#strategies" id="strategies"></a>

Treat it like a stronger version of a Diabolic Skeleton, at level 20/30+ you should be able to kill Teleskor without much problems but expect hits of around 100HP

He is not really fast so you can easily run around the room or if you have good set / melee skills just hit him in close combat.

#### Loot <a href="#loot" id="loot"></a>

Teleskor loot may vary from some platinum coins, gold ingot, etc.
