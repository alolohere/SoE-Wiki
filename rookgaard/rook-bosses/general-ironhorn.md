#### Strategies <a href="#strategies" id="strategies"></a>

General Ironhorn can combo hard up to 500HP so prepare for a hard battle. He shoots some waves in the shape of a stair (X and +) and his melee attack can be deadly so stay ranged running in circles around the room. Heal your self when possible to stay full HP most of the time. Distance ring is recommended.

The room is big enough to run around and hit him with distance, just keep an eye on your HP and run around the stones in the middle.

He have so much HP, so expect a long fight (might take up to 10 minutes or more) so bring enough supplies of pikes and / or potions.

Don't forget to take the 2 chests in the left side of the room once you finish the battle.

#### Loot <a href="#loot" id="loot"></a>

General Ironhorn may vary, but some good items in Rook are dropped by him: Crusader Helmet, Devil Helmet, Dark Armor, Taurus Mace, etc.
