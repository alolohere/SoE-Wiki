Now, take the previous ramp and go north until you find many green tiles on the floor on your way. **Be extremely careful because there are some lavaholes that might hit you really hard**, so prepare to heal your self constantly (pikes, potions…)

There is a specific path you need to follow on the green tiles, if you step wrong you will be teleported to the beginning of the tiles, so be careful and watch the path in detail:

Once you cross all the tiles, you will (most likely) find an energy field. You need to destroy field on it to reveal a secret lever. Use the lever to remove 1 of the previous stones blocking the path.

Go back all the way until the pink stones with the red hexagonal tile, once there step on the second hexagonal tile, you will be teleported to the first. But from now on you can TP your self and cross the stones whenever you want without using the lever before.
