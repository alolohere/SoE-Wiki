Continue climbing the tower, you will find Elfs and Elf Scouts. Once you reach the last level you will face several Elder Elfs careful with them since they can combo hard, specially if you are low level. They behave similar to Elf Arcanists.

At the end you will find a ladder and a warning sign, **Be sure to read carefully what you will face up, THERE IS NO WAY BACK**:

Once you climb the ladder you will be in a close room with **3 Elder Elfs**, and 6 levers.

**Place the levers located inside stones, according to the picture above.** Once all the levers are properly placed, switch the lever on the table (blue circle), if everything is correct levers will turn into small flames, and the tree blocking the path will be removed.

Now, you will be allowed to collect the key on the chest and exit through the teleport.
