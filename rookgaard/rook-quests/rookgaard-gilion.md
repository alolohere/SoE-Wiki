On each mission Gilion will ask to collect some items and bring him back. You can either collect them by your self or just buy to other players.

Start the quest by asking Gilion for a mission:

```
hi - mission - yes
```

* 15 Bear Paws
* 20 Honeycombs

### Mission 2 <a href="#mission_2" id="mission_2"></a>
