# Rook Trainers

Just like Mainland, Training is very important in rook. However unlike Mainland what you decide to train is fully your choice! In rook there is 3 different combat skills you can train that will determine how you play. Note Each skill will take time to train!

### How to train in rook <a href="#how_to_train_in_rook" id="how_to_train_in_rook"></a>

Just like Main land there is 2 ways to train

**Trainer:** First and easy way is to go into soe shop and buy a trainer! these are monk trainers that last 24 hours giving you the ability chose where you train. Do note that these will vanish after 24 hours of the first time you use this! (monk will only attack one player and counts as 2 creatures attacking)

**Target Dummy:** These are server bound trainers, They will always be in a select location for the players to train on, These will do a small burst that hits all targets around them boxed Training shield (if your wearing one) as well as allow you to attack them training weapon skill of chose!

There are 2 spots in Rookgaard with target dummys: one is inside in the shop behind Obi and the other is in the elf tower.

### One handed + shielding <a href="#one_handed_shielding" id="one_handed_shielding"></a>

Just like mainland, This skill will allow you to deal more damage with one handed weapons and protect yourself from damage from monsters, This is perfect skill to level if you plan to play little slower then two handed but safer. This is great for solo players that are just starting and don't know much about rookgaard

### Two handed <a href="#two_handed" id="two_handed"></a>

Two handed is a great skill to level if you wish to deal massive damage, However unlike one handed you will not have a shield meaning you might take way more damage from monsters this is a more risky playstyle but will pay off as missions, tasks and quests will feel a lot faster as you deal massive damage.

### Distance fighting <a href="#distance_fighting" id="distance_fighting"></a>

Distance fighting will start off with spears. This is perfect skill if your play style is more kiting, Distance at first might seem weak at first but as you progress in this skill you will unlock the ability to make arrows giving you access to a bow. You will take a lot more damage then two handed and one handed however you will gain the ability to kite.
