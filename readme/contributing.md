* We understand some people prefer to get right to work, however it may lead to articles being deleted, misinformation spread or offensive content.

#### How to think when contributing to the Wiki <a href="#how_to_think_when_contributing_to_the_wiki" id="how_to_think_when_contributing_to_the_wiki"></a>

* The purpose of the wiki is to help our players and promote new content.
* Consider the age of quests and secrets when updating the wiki. For new content, slight hints and directions are ok but don't spoil it immediately.
* Something that has been out for a while and is likely known by most players shouldn’t be hidden from new players.
* Ask in the wiki team chat in Discord if you are uncertain about something.

#### Spoilers <a href="#spoilers" id="spoilers"></a>

* Some players want to explore the game without being spoiled. Put content that must be explored inside hidden sections.

#### Sections <a href="#sections" id="sections"></a>

* Make sure that all parts of article are understandable and legible.
* Different phases or important things like items needed, special preparations or important spots should be marked as such with proper headline.
