# Fishing Tasks

## Fishing Tasks on Souls of Elysium <a href="#mining_on_souls_of_elysium" id="mining_on_souls_of_elysium"></a>

* Fishing no longer gives direct experience so quests were added to compensate for that.
* To begin you need 25 fishing and have to visit a new NPC located on Senja (via Raft NW of Carlin).
* Finnley is down the stairs to the East from Anderson.

### Fishing Task 1

* To begin simply ask him for a mission or task and reply yes.&#x20;
* If you do not have 25 fishing he will say you need 25 fishing.&#x20;
* This is due to the first fish you need to hand in requiring 25 fishing at the Kazordoon or Hellgate dock.
* If you meet the requirements he will ask you to bring 500 Silverfish. This is the food fish from the above mentioned docks.

* Rejoice, for you do not need to bring all 500 fish at once. You use the brown chest north of Finnley to hand them in.
* Once you have donated ALL 500, talk to Finnley again and ask for a mission or task to complete this part.
* Finnley gives you 7000 gold and you can open door to the first chest on the bottom left, containing 1 gem box and 15000 experience.
