# Upgrading and Rarity

## Upgrading and Rarity Systems <a href="#upgrading_and_rarity_systems" id="upgrading_and_rarity_systems"></a>

On **Souls of Elysium** there are multiple ways to improve your equipment with all sorts of new power!

* Item upgrades which can increase rarity and upgrade bonus.
* Gems that can be attached to weapons to increase attack speed, critical hit and life leech.
* Items can also have a variety of stats, from more hp/mp to additional gold gained from loot.

### Rarity <a href="#rarity" id="rarity"></a>

* Any “gear” (Helmet, Armor, Rings, Weapons, etc) type item can have four levels of rarity.
* Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary.
* Each rarity increases the attributes of the item, the item level and the number of stats possible.
* Common has one, Rare two, Epic three and legendary has four slots for stats.

### Slot specific Secondaries <a href="#slot_specific_secondaries" id="slot_specific_secondaries"></a>

* Each item slot (not backpack or quiver) has its own set of secondary stats it can have.
* For example, a wand has a rare chance of getting an upgrade for magic level, where melee weapons and distance weapons get their respective damage skills.

#### Attribute Bonus <a href="#attribute_bonus" id="attribute_bonus"></a>

* Rarity will give your item increased attack, defense or armor depending on the item type.

| Normal Item            | With Rarity                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Spike Sword (Atk: 24)  | A RARE Spike Sword will have (Atk: 25)      |
| Demon Shield (Def: 35) | An EPIC demon shield will have (Def: 37)    |
| Knight Legs (Arm: 8)   | A LEGENDARY knight legs will have (Arm: 11) |

| Rarity    | Modifier to Base |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Common    | 0                |
| Rare      | +1               |
| Epic      | +2               |
| Legendary | +3               |

#### Item Level Bonus <a href="#item_level_bonus" id="item_level_bonus"></a>

* Rarity of the item will also increase the Item Level.
* Every rarity tier up will double the base item level and increase it with 5 for Rare, 10 for Epic and 15 for Legendary.

| Rarity    | Calculation                        | Example            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Common    | The base item level                | Item level 30      |
| Rare      | Base item level \* 2 + 5           | 30 \* 2 + 5 = 65   |
| Epic      | Base item level \* 3 + 5 + 10      | 30 \* 3 + 15 = 105 |
| Legendary | Base item level \* 4 + 5 + 10 + 15 | 30 \* 4 + 30 = 150 |

#### Rarity Upgrade <a href="#rarity_upgrade" id="rarity_upgrade"></a>

* Upgrading the rarity of an item requires a Rarity Upgrade Crystal. These are primarily crafted but can also be gained from a few quests.&#x20;
* Upgrading rarity is **NOT** guaranteed and there is a chance to fail for each attempt.
* Each failed attempt will increase the chance of a successful upgrade slightly, depending on the current rarity, up to a Maximum of 30%.
* The most difficult upgrade is from Epic to Legendary.

| Upgrade          | Chance |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Common → Rare    | 75%    |
| Rare → Epic      | 45%    |
| Epic → Legendary | 10%    |
|                  |        |

### Unidentified Items <a href="#unidentified_items" id="unidentified_items"></a>

* You can also loot ‘unidentified’ items and they will require a scroll of identification to see its true stats and be able to equip the item.
* Unidentified items can be any rarity and upgrade tier.
* Scrolls of identification can be looted from demonic/diabolic monsters, bought from Eremo or other Players.

### Item Level <a href="#item_level" id="item_level"></a>

* You can gain a bonus to the item for increasing it's Item Level as well.
* Only for the Item Level of a specific item, not total character Item Level.

| Attributes | Gains depending on item level                       |

| Attack     | every 50 item lvl gain +1 attack.                   |
| Defense    | every 50 item lvl gain +1 defense.                  |
| Armor      | every 50 item lvl gain +1 armor.                    |
| HitChance  | every 50 item lvl gain +1 hitchance.(Distance only) |

* On a weapon (Ilvl 50 = +1 att / ilvl 350 is +7 att)
* On a Armor piece (Ilvl 50 = +1 def/arm / ilvl 350 is +7 def/arm)
* On a Distance Weapon (Ilvl 50 = +1 Hit chance / ilvl 350 is +7 Hit Chance) ← including Attack.

### Tips <a href="#tips" id="tips"></a>

* Only upgrade items you plan to use for a while!
* If you know that a monster drops an item, farming it until you get a Legendary might be a wise move for a more powerful version!
* Gem Boxes can be purchased from the [Skull Coin and Hourly Token](skull-coins-hourly-tokens/) shops.

Upgrading Guide (Tentative)

1. First thing you do when you have the proper item is to upgrade it with upgrade crystals.
2. The higher the item level, the higher the rolls on the attributes.
3. Once the item is upgraded, you will need enchantment crystals.
4. One at a time, see if it is an attribute you like.
5. If not, cleansing crystal (or alteration, but cleansings are more common) to erase the attribute and try another enchantment crystal.
6. When you get the attribute you desire, you may want to roll for a higher value.
7. Faith or fortune crystals can be used here for the first attribute (only the first attribute, 2nd, 3rd and 4th you need to only use fortune)
8. When you have landed on the value of the first attribute you want to keep, time to add another enchantment crystal.
9. Because you do not want to mess up the previous attributes, do NOT use faith or cleansing crystals anymore.
10. Now you can rinse and repeat until you get the perfect item with the perfect stats.
