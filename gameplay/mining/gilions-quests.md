# Gilion's Quests

Gilion's Quests are the quests for [Mining](./). Each quest will progress your ability to mine and craft.



**Finding Gilion**

Since the use of mine carts is currently unavailable, you need to enter Kazordoon through the tunnel located to the west of the city. This tunnel can be found by following the path heading west from Kazordoon's entrance. Once you reach the tunnel, you can enter it and proceed to enter the city.

Kazordoon entrance:

Go to the depot and just follow the map:

Keep moving up until you get to the top of the mountain:

Go up twice on the ladders, take the [point of interest](../../exploration/points-of-interest.md) and them move to the right, where you will find the npc Gilion (black circle):

**Walkthrough**

**TIP:** Take dwarf or dwarf soldier task from [Grizzly Adams](../../tasks/grizzly-tasks.md) since you are going to kill many dwarfs on this mission and they can be completed together.

Reach Gilion and ask for a mission:

```
  hi - mission - yes
```

Go down back the way you came, and leave Kazordoon.

You will have to enter on a house, on the right hands side of the center Kazordoon passage, as shown in the yellow circle.&#x20;

Go up the ladder and find a Dwarf guard body on the north side, with the map to deliver to Gillion.

Now you will have to kill 700 Dwarfs (of any kind), once you finish it, return back to Gilion for your rewards and now you can start mission 2.

**NOTE:** Now, you can fast mine ores on the map and use the wagons. North of Gilion you can find a wagon that send you directly to the other wagons, to go wherever you want inside Kazordoon. This is especially relevant for quickly reaching [Trainers](../trainers/).

### Mission 2: 500 Mining Pests <a href="#mission_2500_mining_pests" id="mission_2500_mining_pests"></a>

* Level Required: 0
* Items Required: None

**Rewards**

* 25 Crystal fossils
* Access to the infinite [Hellgate Mine](hellgate-mine.md)

**Walkthrough**

After completing mission 1 ask Gilion for a new mission:

```
Player: Hi
Gilion: ... Greeeeeetiiiingssss...
Player: Mission
Gilion: There have been reports of creatures attacking players while mining. 
        We need to put a stop to this. Will you kill 500 of these pests for us?
Player: yes
Gilion: Excellent! Go and slay those beasts! But please stay safe!
```

Mining a vein has a chance to spawn monsters randomly. Now you have to defeat 500 of these monsters to complete the mission. The monsters are different depending on the vein difficulty (the higher the vein the harder the monster)

See [Mining](./) for a list.

Once you have killed 500 of them, return back to Gilion to collect your rewards and start mission 3.

```
Gilion: ... Greeeeeetiiiingssss...
Player: mission
Gilion: Have you killed 500 of those mining pests?
Player: yes
Gilion: Very good job warrior, Here is your reward!
```

**Walkthrough**

After completing mission 2 ask Gilion for a new mission, Gilion will ask you to bring a lot of mining bars:

```
Player: hi
Player: mission
Gilion: The Kazordoon armory is low on its supply of ingots. Are you willing to help?
Player: yes
Gilion: That's great to hear! Please collect: 500 copper bars, 300 iron bars, 200 mithril bars, 100 adamant bars and 100 rune bars.
```

In order to craft all these bars you will need a lot of ores, but you will have many or even all of them from the previous mission:

Player: mission
Gilion: Have you gathered those ingots?
Player: yes
Gilion: You have been very helpful, I want you to have this item. They say it is used to craft a very powerful pickaxe!
```
