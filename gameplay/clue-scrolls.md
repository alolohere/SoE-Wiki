* This specific clue will require the use of the treasure hunting shovel and treasure compass purchased earlier.
* Go to the general area stated in the clue and use the compass to get specific directions. These may require you to go into caves or up/down floors.

* Continue searching and using the compass until it tells you that you have found the correct spot and use the treasure hunting shovel to dig that spot.
