# Starter Guide for SOE

#### Preparation <a href="#preparation" id="preparation"></a>

**1.** Download the game! You must use the current version [SoE Game Client](https://us.soerpg.com/client.php) to log in and play.\
**2.** Starting the game client will download all required game files. Future updates are also delivered via the client! No need to redownload for updates!\
**3.** Close the client at this step here if you'd like to install the minimap files below!

**Installing a Minimap**

Before you start playing it is \*highly\* recommended that you install the provided base version of the [Minimap](https://soerpg.com/client/minimap772.otmm).\
This package includes the base map only. Further developed areas and custom areas must be explored to discover them on the Minimap.

**1.** Navigate to the directory on your PC: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Souls of Elysium\SoERPG`. (The AppData folder is often hidden by default so if you can't find it you may need to toggle [Show hidden folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5).)\
**2.** Make sure the game client is closed, before putting the downloaded `minimap772.otmm` file into the `SoERPG` directory.<br>

#### First Steps (Level 1-8+) <a href="#first_steps_level_1-8" id="first_steps_level_1-8"></a>

1. Log into your account and make a character in the client or on the website!
2. Just like in many other servers, you start in Rookgaard.
3. Unlike many other servers, Rookgaard has been expanded and holds many secrets, both familiar and new!
4. If you'd like to get started hunting, you can talk to Cipfried and ask for a TASK. Cipfried will ask you to kill 20 rats.
5. Go kill rats either directly under main square, or near the Doublet quest. If the sewers are crowded, you can head south to the lesser hunted ones!
6. As you hunt, you can use the [Autoloot System ](autoloot.md)so you don't have to manually loot every corpse for the basic materials! You can search for items in the UI, or drag and drop items on to the slots!
7. Pick up rats to sell at Tom if you'd like to maximize your profits.
8. Finish up the task, turn it into Cipfried and buy some new gear from Obi and Dixi. Depending on the class you'd like to become, you can start buying Melee gear for Knights, or spears if you plan to be a Paladin/Mage.
9. The second task from Cipfried will be to kill Spiders, get your gear on and start stomping!
10. Spiders can be found all over Rookgaard, inside and outside the walls! There's a spawn directly west of the Temple as well.
11. Take the next task, this one is for Bugs. Bugs often accompany Poison Spiders/Spiders in their spawns, so be careful not to get overwhelmed!
12. Once you're done with tasks from Cipfried you should be able to fight most basic creatures without fear.
13. Keep in mind there are new secrets, monsters and equipment to be found if you stay, but if you're interested in a class..
14. Get level 8 and head to the Mainland or don't, it's up to you! If you'd like to stay, make sure you check out the [Rookgaard](../rookgaard/rookgaard-info.md) page!

**Basic Gameplay Tips for Rook (or beyond!)**

* You can right click full stacks of gold to turn them into higher currency. \[100 Gold → 1 Platinum Coin, 100 Platinum → 1 Crystal Coin ]
* You can purchase Health Potions from Lily, west of the Temple.
* By now you may have seen a [Demonic or Diabolic](diabolic-demonic-monsters.md) monster.. if not.. Be careful! They are exceptionally dangerous, and can kill unprepared adventurers!
* [Fishing](fishing/) is a great way to get some food early, requiring only a Beginner's Fishing Rod which can be bought for 140 gold from Obi and others.
* [Points of Interest](../exploration/points-of-interest.md) reward experience for being found, so keep an eye out!
* [Crafting](crafting.md) and [Upgrading](upgrading-and-rarity.md) exist in Rookgaard, but you will likely not interact with these systems here unless you plan to stay and explore the new content.
* You may have seen items drop with new affixes on them! These secondary stats can vary based on the “rarity” of the item and item level. There's a variety of stats, from Max MP to +Skills and Recoup Damage Taken!

**Basic Class information**

* Druids and Sorcerers can craft different Radiant Wands/Rods that are stronger, and use no mana, letting you spend your mana on attacking and healing instead!
* Knight's Two Handed weapons have a 10% minimum hit, making them quite useful when hunting! No longer just a sword and board class! New weapons! A ranged taunt!
* Paladins have access to a Chain Shot spell, alongside the capacity to summon variety of bolts and arrows, as well as a quiver to hold ammunition!

Check out the [Custom Spells](custom-spells.md) page for more information on what spells have been added to classes.

#### Mainland or Bust! (Level 8-20) <a href="#mainland_or_bust_level_8-20" id="mainland_or_bust_level_8-20"></a>

1. Once you're in the city of your choice, look around the temple for [Leo's Enclave](../tasks/leo-tasks.md) teleport.
2. Speak with Leo and ask him for a Task. He will assign you 150 Trolls and 1 Diabolic Troll.
3. Visit [Grizzly Adams](../tasks/grizzly-tasks.md) wherever he is in your chosen city, and pick up a task for Trolls and Rotworms.
4. Complete your Troll task first. There are a variety of Troll spawns, so head out to your favorite one!
5. Once you're done with the Troll task from Leo, he will assign 200 Rotworms and 1 Diabolic Rotworm.
6. Don't forget to turn in your tasks to Grizzly as well when you pass by!
7. The third Task from Leo will be to kill 15 Low Tier Demonic creatures. Since these can be achieved by killing any low tier monster, you can start hunting other creatures you'd like. Orcs, Minotaurs, Elves and so on are all great options.

**Further Gameplay Tips for Mainland**

* [Public Trainers Quest aka Oin's Quest](trainers/) should be completed as soon as reasonably possible for Knights and Paladins for a place to train when you're not playing, or before you decide to start hunting stronger creatures. Mages do not need to worry, as they can simply use the included Spell Trainer to create runes/summon food, so on and so forth.
* Fishing is a very useful skill to level. As you level it, you will get “health” and “mana” consumables, acting as a free early source of potions. There are better food and mana/health fish as you level the skill, allowing you to obtain some early resources for free.
* [Mining](mining/) nodes start to appear more frequently in spawns, allowing you to start creating items or upgrading a pickaxe.
* A Premium account allows you to start earning [Skull Coins and Hourly Tokens (once level 20)](skull-coins-hourly-tokens/) as well as getting a 10% experience boost, and the ability to buy a House and form a Guild.
* Server Rules allow you to have 2 clients open. Only 1 character is allowed to obtain experience. This allows you to have a Druid/Sorc making runes while you hunt on your main. Make sure to check out the [Rules](../readme/rules.md) for further information.

#### What does the Future hold? (Level 20+) <a href="#what_does_the_future_hold_level_20" id="what_does_the_future_hold_level_20"></a>

* As you start hunting stronger creatures, keep an eye out for better loot! Items can be unexpectedly stronger based on their rarity, so don't discount historically “weaker” items! Each rarity tier up increases Armor/Attack/Defense, so a Dark Helmet (Arm:6) can go up to (Armor:10) depending on the rarity, let alone the secondary stats! Rarity explained further in [Upgrading](upgrading-and-rarity.md).
* Desert Quest (aka 10k Quest, or Level 20 Quest) can be done solo for some early money for potions/supplies.
* You can buy a Mining Pick for 1500 gold, or do [Gilion's Quest](mining/gilions-quests.md) to get one for free, so you can begin harvesting Copper Ore.
* Tasks can be repeated 3 times, so hunting common creatures like Minotaurs/Trolls can be done a few times to start building up some experience and money.
* Djinn\Efreet Quests can be done for access to sell to both.
* [Demonic or Diabolic](diabolic-demonic-monsters.md) Monsters and [Cursed Chests](../exploration/cursed-chests.md) can give Gem and Item boxes, gold, items, materials for crafting and other rewards. They're often dangerous, but give greater rewards! Gems and Materials explained further in [Crafting](crafting.md) and [Upgrading](upgrading-and-rarity.md).
* Higher levels often buy [Skull Coins and Hourly Tokens (once level 20)](skull-coins-hourly-tokens/) for 8-10k gold per, making them a good early source of money.
* There are many [Custom Spawns](../exploration/custom-spawn.md) with a variety of monsters to do tasks on to provide some new hunting areas, loot and visuals!
* Several custom [Quests](../exploration/quests/) to do in addition to the normal ones, most are quite dangerous so bring a friend or two!
* Check out [Dungeons](../exploration/dungeons.md) but bring some friends if you don't want to die!
