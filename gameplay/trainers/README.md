# Trainers

### Trainers on Souls of Elysium <a href="#trainers_on_souls_of_elysium" id="trainers_on_souls_of_elysium"></a>

**Souls of Elysium** offers public trainers to help new players start training, or give you a place to put your character over night!

* You can either visit public trainers in Kazordoon, which spawn after server-save, or use a private one that you can spawn in a place you deem more safe.
* Public Trainers are **NOT** a safe zone, and on PVP worlds you **CAN** be killed there!

#### Public Trainers <a href="#public_trainers" id="public_trainers"></a>

* Public trainers are located in Kazordoon, 3 floors under the Depot .

* [Oin's Quest](oins-quest-public-trainer-access.md) must be completed before you are allowed through the doors.

#### Private Trainers <a href="#private_trainers" id="private_trainers"></a>

* In the Souls of Elysium shop, you can buy Trainer Scroll, which for 24h will allow you to spawn a private trainer using the command !train.
* Every scroll costs 5pp, but they are tradable and can be bought from other players as well.
* Private trainers **CAN** be killed by too much damage, so make sure you don't blast away!
* There is no penalty for attacking someone else trainer, although good etiquette would be to ask before doing so.

* For Auto-Eat Food to work the container with the food must be open.
* Mana Training will cast any spell entered into the text field.
* Rune Maker creates runes entered into the text field if there are blank runes in the backpack.
* The percentages dictate how much mana is required before casting the spell.
* Example: The trainer will make rune “adori vita vis” if the player has 90% or more mana until there are no more blanks. After the blanks run out it switches to “utevo lux” when the player has 95% mana or higher.
