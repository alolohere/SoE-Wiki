Player: Hi
Oin: Hello Human. Are you interested in training?
Player: Training
Oin: Only a proven warrior is allowed to access the training grounds. Let us see how you do with a little 
     test first? We have heard stories of unrest in the dragon graveyard. Travel to Draconia and get word 
     from an Old Dragonlord there, just mention my name to him. Return to me when you have made contact.
```

Be prepared to meet Rotworms, Beholders, Ember Beetles, a Dragon and a Dragon Lord.

Oin will ask you to talk to the Old Dragonlord in Draconia. To get to Draconia you must first travel through Hellgate. The entrance to Hellgate is in Ab'dendriel.

The entrance to Hellgate is locked. If the doors are not already opened you can buy the key from Elathriel for 5000gp. Go to the right and follow the stairs up one floor.
