* Next he asks you to find a Giant Mushroom, seen near the mountains of Darashia.
* For this task you must travel to the mountains west of Darashia.&#x20;
* Once you pass the mountains there is a northern and southern side, go to the southern side and beneath some stone rubble there is a rock pile that you can enter.
