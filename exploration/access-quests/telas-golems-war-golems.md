  Hi - Mission - Yes
```

* To use the elevator, Telas will require 25 iron ore.
* You can get iron ores from mining Iron nodes (Mining Level 20 Required).\*
* Once you do, you have access to the elevator.
* Enter the Worker Golem spawn.
* If you pass through the room with the Worker Golem, you will find a staircase.

* On the lower floor, a mini-quest awaits you. Along the way, you will encounter War Golems, which are significantly stronger than Worker Golems.
* Recommended level is 80+ or 60+ in a party.
* At the end of the path, you will find a quest chest with a reward.

* To open the doors, you will need a Teleport Crystal ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (678).png>)
* It has a small chance of dropping from Worker Golems.
* Once you have obtained the crystal, speak with Telas near the doors.

```
  Hi - Mission - Crystal - Yes
```

* Behind the doors, you will encounter a large spawn of War Golems and another quest. Recommended level is 150+, preferably with a party including a tank.
