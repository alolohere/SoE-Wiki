# Quests

### Quests <a href="#quests" id="quests"></a>

**Souls of Elysium** offers many custom quests, as well as existing ones!

* These new quests can be dangerous so bring a party!
* Not all Quests have been fully solved, so explore at your own peril!
* For normal quests (like Djinn quest, Desert Quest, etc) feel free to use the [Tibia Wiki](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Quests) since they are virtually the same.
* Both Djinn quests can be completed here, however finish one, then the other.
