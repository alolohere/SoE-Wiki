**Souls of Elysium** provides a new and interactive mini-dungeon system, Cursed Chests!

**WARNING: THESE ARE NOT SAFE, IF YOU DIE YOU CAN LOSE ITEMS (without an AOL) AND EXPERIENCE (without blessings)**

* As you explore the world, you will find Cursed Chests which can be opened by saying the phrase “**Aperta**” next to them. Once you have said the phrase, you have an option to dismiss the chest or enter the dangerous realm.
* After entering the pocket dimension, you must face wave of [Demonic and Diabolic creatures](../gameplay/diabolic-demonic-monsters.md).
* Once you clear the waves, the chest can contain a variety of rewards. Experience, gold, rare items and other items.
* Frequently high levels will buy the locations of these chests that lower levels might not be able to clear, a great way to make some money if you come across a chest too difficult for you!
