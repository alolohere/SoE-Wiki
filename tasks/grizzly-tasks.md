#### Tips <a href="#tips" id="tips"></a>

* Take Tasks for all creatures in a spawn, you never know what's around!
* While doing Leo's Tasks it's worth to take the same task from Grizzly to not waste extra time.
* Tasks offer a variety of rewards, and not all monsters are equal so don't be afraid to fight the same monster again to get stronger!
